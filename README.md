# ML-projects
- Machine learning real world projects .
- In some projects I did feature engineering before separating the data set (X_train, x_test etc...), that causes the concept of overfitting at the production level.
- These projects were made in research environment, not in production ,the data we use in learning is static, so there is the journey of machine learning begins when the data changes input (data drift) or output (concept drift) .
- Pipeline can be created at each stage of feature engineering, and of the predictive model .
